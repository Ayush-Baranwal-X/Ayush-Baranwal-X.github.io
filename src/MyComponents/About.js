    const intro = `I'm an IIT Delhi graduate (Class of 2024) and Software Developer with experience building scalable backend and full-stack systems. At Air India, I engineered production apps with Swift and SwiftUI, implementing Core Data architectures, async workflows, and performance optimizations that improved efficiency by over 50%.
                   Beyond work, I thrive at the intersection of systems and product engineering. Iâ€™ve built projects like Fintra (a secure expense tracker with Spring Boot & MongoDB), Blog Express (a full-stack blogging platform on Express & MongoDB), Dmail (a web-based email service on Django), and Noted (a distraction-free, open-source note-taking app). I enjoy designing clean architectures (DDD, event-driven systems), working with modern web stacks, and solving challenging backend problems.`;

    const introExtended = `I'm on a quest to continuously learn, innovate, and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of technology. Let's connect and explore opportunities where I can contribute my technical expertise and passion for software development!`;
